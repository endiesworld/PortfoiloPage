// first commit made on 11/10/2019. This project is no where near completion
   on the day of this commit.
   However, commit has to be made to enable change/progress tracking,
   abd to justify my long stay away from making further contribution to my last,
   repo(memoryGame), this period which was used to familiarise my self with backend knowledge
   using Java with Spring Boot framework.


   To run this project, you should do the following:

		1).  setup a mysql schema with name "myfirst"
		2).  create a table with name "Users".
                3).  mysql username "root".
		4).  mysql password "password". 

	The there shall changes and commits in the following sequence:

	FRONTEND
		1).index page
			i). navbar, button data display mode
			ii). p-tag for(Don't have an account yet ? text)

		2). write a new page for login view, as the present view as at 
		    11/10/2019 comes with a bug on the http header when the sign up button is clicked
		3). Refactor the memoryGame code to accomodate mobile version.
	
	BACKEND
		1). Write all cases for exception handling
		2). Categorize views base on authorization level
		3). Display username when loggd in and game data.

   Other changes and refactoring shall also be introduced when identified. 

Thanks.
